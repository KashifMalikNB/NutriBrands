              A well-balanced DHA and ARA ratio, which reinforces cognitive abilities and the central nervous system, aiding the child's intellectual development.
              A blend of specially selected Probiotics with a high galactose content provides protective properties against intestinal infections. It also has an immunomodulatory effect on the intestinal immune system, favoring the child's development of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, increasing the absorption of minerals, preventing infections and diarrhea.
              This system provides a balanced nutrition for a child's development and prepares the child for a healthy life, aiding in the optimal development of organs, bones and muscles, strengthening their immune system and intellect.

              <li><h2>L-Carnitine</h2></li>
                <p> L-carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that plays an important role in the metabolism of fatty acids. It is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they can be oxidized for energy production. L-carnitine is also important for maintaining energy balance and protecting against oxidative stress.</p>
                <p>In infants, L-carnitine is particularly important as they have a high demand for energy due to their rapid growth and development. L-carnitine is found in breast milk, and levels in breastfed infants are typically higher than in formula-fed infants. However, the levels of L-carnitine in infant formula are regulated by international standards to ensure that formula-fed infants receive adequate amounts.</p>
                <p>Several studies have demonstrated the importance of L-carnitine in infant nutrition. For example, a study published in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition found that premature infants who received a formula supplemented with L-carnitine had higher levels of L-carnitine in their blood and improved growth compared to infants who received a formula without L-carnitine supplementation . Another study published in the Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology found that formula supplemented with L-carnitine improved fat metabolism and energy production in term infants .</p>
                <p>Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition concluded that L-carnitine supplementation in premature infants may have beneficial effects on growth and metabolism. The review analyzed data from 10 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 489 premature infants and found that L-carnitine supplementation was associated with improved weight gain, reduced length of hospital stay, and improved energy metabolism .</p>
                <p>In summary, L-carnitine is an important component of infant nutrition that plays a key role in energy metabolism and growth. While breast milk is a natural source of L-carnitine, formula-fed infants can receive adequate amounts through supplementation. Studies have shown that L-carnitine supplementation may have beneficial effects on growth and metabolism in premature infants.</p>

              <li><h2>DHA & AA</h2></li>
                  <p>Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) that are important components of infant nutrition. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that is important for brain and eye development, while AA is an omega-6 fatty acid that is important for immune system function and growth.</p>
                  <p>Several studies have demonstrated the importance of DHA and AA in infant nutrition. A randomized controlled trial published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that infants who received formula supplemented with DHA and AA had better visual acuity and cognitive development at 12 months compared to infants who received formula without DHA and AA . Another randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that formula supplemented with DHA and AA was associated with improved mental processing and language development at 18 months .</p>
                  <p>In addition, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews concluded that supplementation of infant formula with DHA and AA may have beneficial effects on visual acuity and cognitive development in term infants. The review analyzed data from 26 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 9,958 infants and found that DHA and AA supplementation was associated with improved visual acuity and cognitive development at 2 years of age .</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, breast milk is a natural source of DHA and AA, and studies have shown that infants who are breastfed have higher levels of these fatty acids in their blood compared to infants who are formula-fed without DHA and AA supplementation.</p>
                  <p>In summary, DHA and AA are important components of infant nutrition that are essential for optimal growth and development. Studies have shown that formula supplemented with DHA and AA may improve visual acuity, cognitive development, and language development in infants. However, it is important to note that breast milk is the preferred source of nutrition for infants, and formula should only be used when breast milk is not available or as recommended by a healthcare professional.</p>

              <li><h2>Probiotics</h2></li>
                  <p>Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host. They are commonly added to foods or supplements and are known to have various health benefits, including improving gut health, boosting the immune system, and preventing infections. Probiotics are also important in infant nutrition as they can help establish a healthy microbiome and support the development of the immune system.</p>
                  <p>Several studies have demonstrated the importance of probiotics in infant nutrition. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the journal Nutrients found that probiotics given to preterm infants reduced the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious intestinal disease that can occur in premature infants. The review analyzed data from 24 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 4,575 preterm infants and found that probiotic supplementation was associated with a significantly reduced risk of NEC .</p>
                  <p>Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that formula supplemented with a probiotic mixture (Bifidobacterium lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus) reduced the risk of respiratory infections in infants compared to formula without probiotic supplementation. The study involved 94 healthy term infants and found that the group receiving the probiotic-supplemented formula had a significantly lower incidence of respiratory infections compared to the group receiving the unsupplemented formula .</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, a randomized controlled trial published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that probiotic supplementation in the first six months of life reduced the risk of developing eczema in infants with a family history of allergies. The study involved 159 infants with a family history of allergies and found that probiotic supplementation was associated with a significantly reduced risk of eczema at 24 months of age .</p>
                  <p>In summary, probiotics are an important component of infant nutrition that can help establish a healthy microbiome and support the development of the immune system. Studies have shown that probiotic supplementation may reduce the risk of serious intestinal diseases, respiratory infections, and eczema in infants.</p>

              <li><h2>Taurine</h2></li>
                  <p>Taurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is important for a range of physiological processes, including bile acid synthesis, osmoregulation, and the function of the nervous system. Taurine is found naturally in breast milk and some animal-based foods, but it is not present in plant-based foods. Taurine has been identified as an important nutrient in infant nutrition, particularly for premature infants.</p>
                  <p>A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics found that preterm infants who received a formula supplemented with taurine had better visual acuity than infants who received unsupplemented formula. The study involved 39 preterm infants who were randomized to receive either formula supplemented with taurine or unsupplemented formula. Infants in the taurine-supplemented group had significantly better visual acuity at 6 weeks and 6 months of age compared to the unsupplemented group .</p>
                  <p>Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that infants who were fed a formula supplemented with taurine had higher plasma taurine levels than infants who received unsupplemented formula. The study involved 14 healthy term infants who were randomized to receive either taurine-supplemented formula or unsupplemented formula. Infants in the taurine-supplemented group had significantly higher plasma taurine levels at 7 and 14 days of age compared to the unsupplemented group .</p>
                  <p>In addition to its role in visual acuity and plasma taurine levels, taurine has also been shown to have a range of other physiological effects. A review published in the journal Nutrients found that taurine is important for the development and function of the central nervous system, and that taurine supplementation may be beneficial for infants with developmental disorders .</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, taurine is an important nutrient in infant nutrition, particularly for premature infants. Taurine supplementation has been shown to improve visual acuity and increase plasma taurine levels in infants. Taurine also has other physiological effects, such as supporting the development and function of the nervous system.
